# Data Science Course at SDU

This repo consists of several components created by Data Science Europe (Please see the hadoop and spark folders for their readme files), but has been restructured into a part of a course run at the University of Southern Denmark.

The course/repo is run/maintained by Jakob Hviid <jah@mmmi.sdu.dk> and Fisayo Caleb Sangogboye <fsan@mmmi.sdu.dk>.

## Setup

In the root directory run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

A sample of how to connect to spark is provided in example.py
